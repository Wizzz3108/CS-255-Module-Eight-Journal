# The DriverPass project involved designing a digital system for DriverPass, a driving instruction company. The client wanted a system that could deliver online lessons, quizzes, and practice tests, manage in-person driving lessons, generate student performance reports, and automate administrative tasks. The system also needed role-based access, integration with DMV content, and tiered driving packages to accommodate different student needs. One part I did particularly well was describing the purpose of the system clearly, including its goals, DMV integration, user-level access, and driving packages. If I could revise one part of my work, I would focus on the functional and nonfunctional requirements. For example, I could provide more detail on on-demand report generation, specific performance expectations like page load times, and the rationale for using MySQL and AWS to ensure scalability and security. This would make the requirements more thorough and better aligned with the grading rubric.

# I interpreted the userâ€™s needs by analyzing the interview document and identifying pain points such as missed appointments, inefficient scheduling, and lack of progress tracking. I implemented these needs into the system design with features like automated scheduling, dashboards for student progress, notifications for DMV updates, and role-based access. Considering user needs is critical because a system that does not fit real-world workflows cannot improve efficiency or provide value. When designing software, I approach the process by understanding the problem, breaking the system into logical components, and defining clear requirements. In the future, I plan to use techniques like prototyping, user story mapping, and iterative feedback to ensure my designs remain user-centered, adaptable, and technically sound.
